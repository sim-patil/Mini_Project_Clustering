# Mini-Project : Customer Segmentation using Clustering

### Learning Objectives:

* Learn the basic machine learning algorithms such as unsupervised Learning: K-Means clustering.
* Practice applying machine learning algorithms to real data. 

Machine Learning algoriths used:
1. Elbow Sum-of-Squares Method
2. Silhouette Method
3. Gap Statistic
4. Visualizing Clusters using PCA
5. Affinity propagation
6. Spectral clustering
7. Agglomerative clustering
8. DBSCAN

### Data:

The dataset contains information on marketing newsletters/e-mail campaigns (e-mail offers sent to customers) and transaction level data from customers. The transactional data shows which offer customers responded to, and what the customer ended up buying. The data is presented as an Excel workbook containing two worksheets. Each worksheet contains a different dataset.
